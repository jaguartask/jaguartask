There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Jaguar Task

## Sub-Heading ##
  Your To-Do list, but shareable and fun.

## Summary ##
   Use Jaguar Task to make lists of the things you need to do, share them with the right people, and level up your character as you get more stuff done.

## Problem ##
  It is hard or impossible to share most to-do lists or sub-lists with other people. Also, to-do lists are generally boring or associated with dread.

## Solution ##
  Jaguar Task lets you email a list, sub-list, or single task to another person. That person just clicks a link that takes them to our web app where they can interact with the list themselves. Also, the more you accomplish on your to-do list, the more points you get to level up your profile.

## Quote from You ##
  "You may find yourself wishing people asked you to do more stuff", says project manager Gabriel Meyr.

## How to Get Started ##
  Get started by signing in on the homepage, and then just typing out your first list.

## Customer Quote ##
  "It's great because now my wife and I can share shopping lists with each other when one of us is at the store."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Your stuff needs to get done, but it doesn't have to be on your own, and it doesn't have to be boring. Level up the way you get things done with Jaguar Task.
